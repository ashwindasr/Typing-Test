## Inspiration
There are a lot of Typing Tests online. But almost all those website is filled with ads. Thats why we built this minimalistic website to check your typing speed.

## What we want it to do
Just start typing on the text box and press ```Enter``` once you finish typing. The typing speed and accuracy will be displayed.

## How we built it
We used React and Reactstrap for the front end and NodeJS and MongoDB Atlas for the backend and hosted the website in Google Cloud.

## Challenges we ran into
All the technologies that we used in this project (React, NodeJS and MongoDB) were completely new to us. So it took quite a lot of effort to learn all these technologies and build a application within 2 days.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even though at times we thought we couldn't finish the project in time, we somehow managed to finish and submit on time.

## What we learned
We learned about React, Reactstrap, NodeJS, MongoDB and the Google Cloud platform.
## What's next for Typing test
We plan to improve the UI and add several other features as well, like login.
